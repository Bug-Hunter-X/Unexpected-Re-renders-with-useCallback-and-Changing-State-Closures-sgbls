This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that has a closure over a value that changes on every render.  The `useCallback` hook is designed to memoize a function, only creating a new function when one of its dependencies changes.  However, if the function internally references a value that changes on every render (e.g., state from `useState`), a new function will be created on every render, defeating the purpose of `useCallback`. This can lead to unexpected re-renders and performance issues.
